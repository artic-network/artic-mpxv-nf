# Artic Network MPXV Analysis

Run the ARTIC fieldbioinformatics workflow on multiplexed MPXV ONT data


## Introduction

The artic-mpxv-nf workflow implements an ARTIC FieldBioinformatics
workflow for the purpose of preparing consensus sequences from MPXV
genomes that have been DNA sequenced using a pooled tiling amplicon strategy.

## Install and run


These are instructions to install and run the workflow on command line.
You can also access the workflow via the
[EPI2ME Desktop application](https://labs.epi2me.io/downloads/).

The workflow uses [Nextflow](https://www.nextflow.io/) to manage
compute and software resources,
therefore Nextflow will need to be
installed before attempting to run the workflow.

The workflow can currently be run using either
[Docker](https://www.docker.com/products/docker-desktop
or [Singularity](https://docs.sylabs.io/guides/3.0/user-guide/index.html)
to provide isolation of the required software.
Both methods are automated out-of-the-box provided
either Docker or Singularity is installed.
This is controlled by the
[`-profile`](https://www.nextflow.io/docs/latest/config.html#config-profiles)
parameter as exemplified below.

It is not required to clone or download the git repository
in order to run the workflow.
More information on running EPI2ME workflows can
be found on our [website](https://labs.epi2me.io/wfindex).

The following command can be used to obtain the workflow.
This will pull the repository in to the assets folder of
Nextflow and provide a list of all parameters
available for the workflow as well as an example command:

```
nextflow run artic-network/artic-mpxv-nf --help
```
To update a workflow to the latest version on the command line use
the following command:
```
nextflow pull artic-network/artic-mpxv-nf
```

## Input example

<!---Example of input directory structure, delete and edit as appropriate per workflow.--->
This workflow accepts FASTQ files as input.

The FASTQ input parameters for this workflow accept one of three cases: (i) the path to a single FASTQ; (ii) the path to a top-level directory containing FASTQ files; (iii) the path to a directory containing one level of sub-directories which in turn contain FASTQ files. In the first and second cases (i and ii), a sample name can be supplied with `--sample`. In the last case (iii), the data is assumed to be multiplexed with the names of the sub-directories as barcodes. In this case, a sample sheet can be provided with `--sample_sheet`.

```
(i)                     (ii)                 (iii)    
input_reads.fastq   ─── input_directory  ─── input_directory
                        ├── reads0.fastq     ├── barcode01
                        └── reads1.fastq     │   ├── reads0.fastq
                                             │   └── reads1.fastq
                                             ├── barcode02

                                             └── barcode03
                                              └── reads0.fastq

## Input parameters

### Input Options

| Nextflow parameter name  | Type | Description | Help | Default |
|--------------------------|------|-------------|------|---------|
| fastq | string | FASTQ files to use in the analysis. | This accepts one of three cases: (i) the path to a single FASTQ file; (ii) the path to a top-level directory containing FASTQ files; (iii) the path to a directory containing one level of sub-directories which in turn contain FASTQ files. In the first and second case, a sample name can be supplied with `--sample`. In the last case, the data is assumed to be multiplexed with the names of the sub-directories as barcodes. In this case, a sample sheet can be provided with `--sample_sheet`. |  |
| analyse_unclassified | boolean | Analyse unclassified reads from input directory. By default the workflow will not process reads in the unclassified directory. | If selected and if the input is a multiplex directory the workflow will also process the unclassified directory. | False |


### Primer Scheme Selection

| Nextflow parameter name  | Type | Description | Help | Default |
|--------------------------|------|-------------|------|---------|
| scheme_version | string | Primer scheme name. | Version of the primer scheme to use, `yale-mpox/2000/v1.0.0-cladei` and `yale-mpox/2000/v1.0.0-cladeii` are the same scheme but use separate reference fastas. If you select `artic-inrb-mpox/2500/v1.0.0` the pipeline will attempt to select the appropriate remap of the scheme based on your read data. If you have a custom scheme you can enter the details in the `custom_scheme` parameter. | artic-inrb-mpox/2500/v1.0.0 |
| custom_scheme | string | Path to a custom scheme. | If you have a custom primer scheme you can enter the details here. This must be the full path to the directory containing your appropriately named scheme bed and fasta files; primer.bed and reference.fasta. |  |


### Sample Options

| Nextflow parameter name  | Type | Description | Help | Default |
|--------------------------|------|-------------|------|---------|
| sample_sheet | string | A CSV file used to map barcodes to sample aliases. The sample sheet can be provided when the input data is a directory containing sub-directories with FASTQ files. | The sample sheet is a CSV file with, minimally, columns named `barcode` and `alias`. Extra columns are allowed. A `type` column is required for certain workflows and should have the following values; `test_sample`, `positive_control`, `negative_control`, `no_template_control`. |  |
| sample | string | A single sample name for non-multiplexed data. Permissible if passing a single .fastq(.gz) file or directory of .fastq(.gz) files. |  |  |


### Output Options

| Nextflow parameter name  | Type | Description | Help | Default |
|--------------------------|------|-------------|------|---------|
| out_dir | string | Directory for output of all workflow results. |  | output |

### Advanced Options

| Nextflow parameter name  | Type | Description | Help | Default |
|--------------------------|------|-------------|------|---------|
| artic_threads | number | Number of CPU threads to use per artic task. | The total CPU resource used by the workflow is constrained by the executor configuration. | 4 |
| list_schemes | boolean | List primer schemes and exit without running analysis. |  | False |
| min_len | number | Minimum read length (default: set by scheme). |  |  |
| max_len | number | Maximum read length (default: set by scheme). |  |  |
| normalise | integer | Depth ceiling for depth of coverage normalisation |  | 200 |
| override_model | string | Override auto-detected clair3 model. This parameter can be used to override the detected value (or to provide a model name if none was found in the inputs). However, users should only do this if they know for certain which model was used as selecting the wrong option might give sub-optimal results. A list of models is available [here](https://github.com/nanoporetech/rerio/tree/master/clair3_models). |  |
